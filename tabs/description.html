<div href="#" class="close" onclick="removeText('content')"></div>
<div>This description is loaded via Ajax. Below, a tabbed section contains the project requirements. </div>
<div>The My Biography tab uses pagination. "Other Projects" tab is called "Grow Your Career" and loads my personal website
    <a class="a" href="https://growyourcareer.com" target="_blank" > GrowYourCareer.com </a>
</div>
<div>The favicon.ico used, along with any other images, were created by me in Adobe Photoshop and Fireworks.
They were created previously and not specifically for this project.</div>
<div>I also created a CSS-based 'X' in the upper right corner of content divs, to close content. The default tab displays an example
    of nested tabs. No frameworks (e.g., JQuery) were used in this project.
Some boilerplate code (e.g., check browser type) was used from examples in the course and online. In addition, I relied
heavily on examples from the dynamicdrive.com site to make things work. </div>
